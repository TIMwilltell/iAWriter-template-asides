# A GitHub Style Template with "Asides"

This is the stock version of the iA Writer GitHub template with a few modifications to add support for an aside. I got a tremendous help from [f1se4](https://github.com/f1se4)'s template on GitHub. His template goes far beyond this one adding support for third party tools.

## Installation

To use this as a template in iA Writer, download the latest release and open the `.iatemplate` file with iA Writer.

## Asides

This template supports the use of **Asides** to call out information in different ways. Information can be called out as a tip, warning, information, caution, or note. They function as a custom HTML element `<tip></tip>`.

## Code Highlighting

Support for syntax highlighting has been added through [Hightlight.js](https://hightlightjs.org) and [CDNJS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/highlight.js). Include the name of the language after the first set of backticks to use â€“ ` ```javascript`.
